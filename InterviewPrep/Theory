1. How does hash table work.
For every key, the "hashing function" creates an "index", which denotes the spot at which the "value" corresponding to this key will be
stored.
Sometimes, the same index might be generated for 2 keys, causing a "collision".
Collision resolution - when it does occur, look from that point on for the next "open" slot, also called as 
"open addressing".
Another approach is "chaining" where the index locaiton in the array now stores a pointer to a collection 
(as many items as have the same index). The more the collisions, the more the number of items in that collection,
hence more difficult to search.
